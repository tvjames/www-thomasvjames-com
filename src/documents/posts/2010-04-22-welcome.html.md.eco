This blog is started to chronicle the public musings of an Australian related to technology, software development, gadgets and photography.





I was one of the 75 lucky (or very stupid) people to pre-order and now own a [JooJoo](http://thejoojoo.com/). I also own a [Nokia N900](http://maemo.nokia.com/n900/). I'm pretty much your average computer geek, I run a virtualised server on an old MacBook Pro at home, a couple of paid for cheap VPS and run my own servers.





I'm a software developer by day, mostly building web apps in asp.net using C#, by night I'm on my MacBook Pro surfing the web, reading feeds and technology blogs and working out where next to spend my money.
