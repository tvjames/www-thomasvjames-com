I've had my previous MacBook Air for sale up on Gumtree Brisbane now for a few weeks, a few days ago i lowered the price and bumped it up the list. This resulted in while a few enquiries, none more strange than the following. Punctuation is as it was received.





<blockquote>
  
> 
> Did you sell yours macbook?
> 
> 
  
  
> 
> <blockquote>
    
>> 
>> It is still for sale
>>

  </blockquote>
>

  </blockquote>
>

> Can you give ,, discount,,
  Because i don't havw enough money, but i really want tp buy yours macbook ,,
  If you can give discount a lot I ll buy today,,
>

</blockquote>





At this point I had a few things to do at home, so i didnt reply right away. Within 5 minutes i had the following messages waiting for me.





<blockquote>
  
> 
> R u okay,,?
  Hell
  Hello,?
  O

</blockquote>





I decided i would reply, maybe they would be able to meet my price.





<blockquote>

>> How much are you willing to spend?
>> 
>> 
  </blockquote>
> 
> 
  
  
> 
> 600,,, if u can give me 600 ,, i m going to buy!

>

  </blockquote>

Now it starts to get a little weird, the prospective buyer cant meet my price and starts to **beg**.





<blockquote>
  
> 
> Please,,,,.,,

> 
> <blockquote>
    
>> 
>> Sorry i am not willing to sell at 600
>> 
>> 
  </blockquote>
>

> 
> How much ,, you want to ,

> <blockquote>
    
>> 
>> 700
>> 
>> 
  </blockquote>
> 
> 
  
  
> 
> Please,, if you can give me 600 i m going to now,, please
> 
> 
  
  
> 
> <blockquote>
    
>> 
>> No I cannot do 600
>> 
>> 
  </blockquote>
> 
> 
  
  
> 
> ,,,, i really really want to buy,,
  Please,,,
>

</blockquote>





An hour later





<blockquote>
  
> 
> Please,,,,,,
> 
> 
</blockquote>





Another hour later





<blockquote>
  
> 
> No 650,,,?
> 
> 
</blockquote>





**Protip** for bargining with a private seller, dont beg. It aint going to help you.
