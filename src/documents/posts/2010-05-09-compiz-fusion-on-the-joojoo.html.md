With a bit of digging it appears that the JooJoo is running Compiz Fusion as its window manager. With a bit of searching a number of sources are available for the list of keyboard shortcuts that might be available on the JooJoo and with those some hope of getting low level access.





I've found these two sources useful:







  * [Compix Fusion Keyboard Shortcuts](http://ulyssesonline.com/2007/10/25/compiz-fusion-keyboard-shortcuts/)


  * [CommonKeyboardShortcuts](http://wiki.compiz.org/CommonKeyboardShortcuts)





With these two sources I can confirm the following shortcuts work (but aren't very useful):







  * Show/Clear Desktop    Ctrl + Alt + D (toggle)


  * Close Window          Alt + F4


  * Minimise Window       Alt + F9


  * Window Menu           Alt + Space





Unfortunately the most useful one of all Alt + F2 (Run Dialog) does not work, but I guess that would be too easy.
