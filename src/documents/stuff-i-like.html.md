## Stuff I Like

### Kickstarter

[Jot: Capacitive Touch Stylus by Adonit!](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/531383637/jot-capacitive-touch-stylus) **Shipped**

A precision stylus designed for capacitive touch screens.

[Sensu Brush: A True Painting Experience on Your iPad](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/797362124/sensu-brush-a-true-painting-experience-on-your-ipa) **Shipped**

Capacitive stylus designed to allow a more paintbrush like approach to drawing input on an iPad. This one was a backed on-behalf of someone else.

[Ninja Blocks: Connect your world with the web.](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ninja/ninja-blocks-connect-your-world-with-the-web) **Fulfilled**

Sadly I only backed early access to the software on this one. Once it was in general production I didn't hesitate to buy a home kit.

[Pebble: E-Paper Watch for iPhone and Android](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android) **Shipped**

Like many others, I did my small part in making this one of the most, if not the most, successful kickstarter campaigns in history. There are mixed reactions to this one once it shipped but I am completely happy with my Pebble smart watch. Doubly so after the recent software updates for iOS.

[Let's Code: Test-Driven Javascript](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/188988365/lets-code-test-driven-javascript) **Fulfilled**

This proved to be quite a useful little adventure into the many options available when looking at developing in JavaScript. Provided someone for the seasoned developer as much as the junior.

[Drifter: A Space Trading Game](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/celsiusgs/drifter-a-space-trading-game) **Funded** _in-beta_

The first of many games that I've backed on kickstarter.

[t≈çd:Connect Real World Actions to Mobile Devices and the Web](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rowdyrobot/tod-connect-real-world-actions-to-mobile-devices-a) **Shipped**

Interesting approach to a smart beacon. Lots of idea, however they're still just sitting on my desk.

[Planetary Annihilation - A Next Generation RTS](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/659943965/planetary-annihilation-a-next-generation-rts) **Funded**

As a long time fan of Total Annihilation this one caught my interest right off the bat. I had no choice but to back it. And how can anyone say "no" to blowing up planets TA style?

[Parallella: A Supercomputer For Everyone](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adapteva/parallella-a-supercomputer-for-everyone) **Funded** _Delayed_

I've always been interested in embedded development of all sorts. This one looked like an interesting project and an opportunity to try out FPGA development, which is something I've not done before. I do hope they'll be able to overcome their production issues and eventually ship.

[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adapteva/parallella-a-supercomputer-for-everyone](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jorno/jorno-the-pocketable-folding-bluetooth-keyboard) **Funded** _In Doubt_

It's a folding, bluetooth keyboard for the iDevices. Would have been useful.

[Star Citizen](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cig/star-citizen) **Funded** _Physical rewards shipped_

Yup, another game.

[Strike Suit Zero](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/43153532/strike-suit-zero) **Funded** _in-beta_

More game.

[Elite: Dangerous](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1461411552/elite-dangerous) **Funded**

Can you see a trend here?

[AGENT: The World's Smartest Watch](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/secretlabs/agent-the-worlds-smartest-watch) **Funded**

As a long time fan and owner of multiple netduino devices, I couldn't go past the opportunity to back a .net micro-framework / C# powered smart watch, no matter how happy I am with the Pebble. Appears to be on track to ship no too long after the target date as well.

[Chineasy: The easiest way to learn Chinese](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shaolanchineasy/chineasy-begins-0) **Funded**

Just a long line, in a somewhat futile attempt, to better learn and understand the language, culture and ancestry of my "better-half". I'm looking forward to adding a few extra characters to my limited repertoire.

[Cable-Anchor : no more tangled cable](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/502701513/cable-anchor) **Shipped**

Cheap, low-risk approach to trying to tidy some cables.

[Obduction](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cyaninc/obduction) **Funded**

Myst, my first game on CD and something that really spurned my imagination, Obduction is a modern "follow up" by the same creators of the earlier masterpieces. This game could not be ready to play soon enough. I want now!

[KeyZ - Bulky Keys Made Easy](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/key-z/keyz-bulky-keys-made-easy) **Will be funded**

Interesting retake of the humble keyring. Combined with a multi-tool :)

[Lavabit's Dark Mail Initiative](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ladar/lavabits-dark-mail-initiative) **Pending** _Not looking likely to be funded_

Happy to throw a few dollars behind this initiative.

[NINJA SPHERE: Next Generation Control of Your Environment](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ninja/ninja-sphere-next-generation-control-of-your-envir) **Will be funded**

After the success of the original ninja block, started by the guy behind Sydney electronics outfit - Little Bird Electronics, I'm not missing out of version 2.

[Touch Board: Interactivity Everywhere](Touch Board: Interactivity Everywhere) **Will be funded**

Having too many random arduinos, netduinos, rPIs & other things around the house. What's one more?

[nio Card - Slims down your wallet and upgrades your phone](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1459210729/nio-card-a-smart-card-which-upgrades-your-phone-an) **Pending** _Could go either way_

Lots of potential.

### Others

[Coin](https://onlycoin.com/) **Preorder**

Developed for the american market, where magnetic stipe cards are the latest-and-greatest, this little device provides a dynamic approach loading and restoring the strip data based on the card you choose from your phone. I wont be putting my credit card into this, but might be a great way to get rid of a lot of loyalty cards.
