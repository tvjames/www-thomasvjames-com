In response to [CEO Friday: Why we don’t hire .NET programmers](http://blog.expensify.com/2011/03/25/ceo-friday-why-we-dont-hire-net-programmers/).

**Wow** … someone drank the Kool-aid.

I find it sad that a startup CEO appears to have such an unfounded bias towards a particular group of the software development community, i assume this could only be through negative personal experiences or based on poor "trusted" advice.

I feel insulted that as a .net developer by choice, having developed on many other platforms and still developing on other platforms this person believes that i am only capable of pushing buttons to get the tools to write my code for me. The implied personality failings and inability to learn new technology of .net developers is appalling.

Then there are the technical faults which his stated fact, he states that while .net gives you the tools to create one kind of widget, if you want to create that widget with a slight modification then you cant. This couldn't be further from the truth and really calls out the lack of knowledge of the author. The author would probably not be willing to state the same assertions about Java or Python even though the technology is similar or arguably more advanced now than the JVM with all the new C# syntactic sugar, function language enhancements to the runtime and F#.

It trivialises the work of super-stars of the .net world like [Miguel de Icaza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Icaza) which have put .net on Android and iOS, made the C# compiler available as service (think shell scripting in C#) on posix operating systems (Linux, Unix & BSD) and of course put the .net framework on Linux in the first place.

So lets blame the developers that use the technology for the faults of the platform, language and the company backing it. GAH
