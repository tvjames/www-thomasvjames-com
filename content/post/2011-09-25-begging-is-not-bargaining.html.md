I've had my previous MacBook Air for sale up on Gumtree Brisbane now for a few weeks, a few days ago i lowered the price and bumped it up the list. This resulted in while a few enquiries, none more strange than the following. Punctuation is as it was received.

> Did you sell yours macbook?
>> It is still for sale
> How much,
>> 800 or make an offer
> Can you give ,, discount,,
> Because i don't havw enough money, but i really want tp buy yours macbook ,,
> If you can give discount a lot I ll buy today,,

At this point I had a few things to do at home, so i didnt reply right away. Within 5 minutes i had the following messages waiting for me.

> R u okay,,?
> Hell
> Hello,?
> O

I decided i would reply, maybe they would be able to meet my price.

>> How much are you willing to spend?
> 600,,, if u can give me 600 ,, i m going to buy!
>> Sorry that is too low.

Now it starts to get a little weird, the prospective buyer cant meet my price and starts to **beg**.

> Please,,,,.,,
>> Sorry i am not willing to sell at 600
> How much ,, you want to ,
>> 700
> Please,, if you can give me 600 i m going to now,, please
>> No I cannot do 600
> ,,,, i really really want to buy,,
> Please,,,

An hour later

> Please,,,,,,

Another hour later

> No 650,,,?

**Protip** for bargining with a private seller, dont beg. It aint going to help you.
