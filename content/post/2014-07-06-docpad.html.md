I've been wanting to redesign the layout & theme of this blog for quite some time. *It was dated*. With the task of developing a custom wordpress theme ahead of me, I looked at other options. Static site generators that use existing templating libraries & markdown sounded like a good way to go, and allowed me to avoid having to learn to create a wordpress theme at the same time. The frontrunners I considered were Jekyll, Octopress & DocPad.

I decided to go with the following:
* [DocPad](http://docpad.org/) for the site generation
* [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) for comments
* [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) as the base style
* [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) for build
* [Public GitHub Repo](https://github.com/tvjames/www-thomasvjames-com) *fork me :)*
* Remain hosted where it already is (private server & some AWS plumping)

Although I chose not to use Jekyll, I found Hadi Hariri's article [Migrating from WordPress.com to Jekyll](http://hadihariri.com/2013/12/24/migrating-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/) quite helpful in planning out the move to docpad. It gave me a number of things to consider, much of it applying to docpad, including migraing existing content to markdown, which can be consumed almost as-is by docpad. Some manual cleaning up of the html to markdown converted text was required.

Overall the move to docpad was a pretty smooth one, plugins are required to achieve much of the like-for-like behaviour with the wordpress blog that I desired. This included clean URLs with the publish date in the path, tag/category listing pages & generating RSS feeds. Most plugins work as expected with varying options for customising to your liking.

Tweeting links to posts has become a manual task for the moment though... *all in good time*
