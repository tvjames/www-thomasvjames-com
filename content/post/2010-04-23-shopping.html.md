In the quest to get the most out of the JooJoo i've ordered these two items:

  1. [Option GTM378 mini PCIE Card UMTS HSDPA WWAN](http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=290397927239&ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT#shId)
  2. [SSDMA ( mSATA/PATA mobile SSD to USB host adapter ver1.1 )](http://www.hwtools.net/Adapter/SSDMA.html)

Hopefully will be able to further explore the internals once these two items arrive and I look forward to the challenge of getting the 3G card working.
